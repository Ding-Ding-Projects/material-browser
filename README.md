# Material Browser

An encrypted browser-profile workspace for Windows, with optional self-hosted storage.

**Development status:** source implementation and focused local checks are in progress. Automated development installers are [published](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-browser/releases/tag/build-3-39195138374-1); the product is not release-ready and native installation acceptance remains incomplete.
Live snapshots, portable browser credentials and advanced identity controls require managed
browser integrations and must not be inferred from the interface or profile-file copying.

The encrypted core, desktop workspace, native control transports, interactive documentation,
storage service and portable hosting wizard have source implementations. Focused checks have
passed separately, but the combined application is not release-ready. The final native
lifecycle candidate passed six real hidden-desktop runs covering both engines locally and
over paired LAN, attached-client contention and an already-closed browser. It verifies exact
process ownership and complete owned-job exit before releasing the profile. Earlier
launcher-only stop results remain superseded. Native credential portability, consistent live
snapshots, advanced identity, published storage and two-computer proof remain incomplete.

The public handbook is deployed from source `b9b892b` and publication `fa75573`. All 21 bundled
documentation/wiki routes rendered in a real browser, and all eight delivered files matched
their published hashes. Guided examples, search, reading preferences and narrow navigation
were exercised. The repository homepage points to the exact deployed URL above. This bounded
documentation result does not establish complete required-feature acceptance.

The separate offline handbook was built and launched as one unsigned portable executable
at source `1cd196b`. All 21 routes, embedded assets and full-restart reading-state persistence
were verified locally. It has not yet been published as a downloadable release asset.


## Desktop capture evidence

These genuine captures show the packaged desktop at source `7257d2238a6c6a495c84321a98bffc283450af9c`, built through `build-installer.bat -Component Desktop`. They use a fresh synthetic vault and the real bundled native host on an isolated background desktop. The page viewport is explicitly emulated at 1280 by 1000, scale 1; this is not a claim of physical display-scale coverage.

The workflow created a vault and profile, skipped optional synchronization, saved automation from Off to Selenium, and changed language/theme through the interface. Effective automation remains unavailable: no managed browser was launched in this capture run. The updated-at value remains unavailable. Native installation, restart persistence, keyboard-only input, a complete scale/language matrix and overall accessibility acceptance remain unverified. [Evidence inventory](docs/evidence/desktop/inventory.json).

Settings now contains ten categories and 37 validated local preferences, with contextual help,
practice values, schedules, notifications, history/export workflows, installed-font discovery
and bounded external-editor handoff. Eleven reviewed state-transition repairs are integrated.
The native preference and protected-history GUI integration remains in progress. The
[required-feature inventory](docs/features/desktop/settings-acceptance.json) still records
65 desktop-applicable rows with none claimed comprehensively complete. Explanatory localization,
actual audio, deeper appearance controls, complete regex parity and the full layout matrix
remain among the explicit gaps.

## Portable handbook evidence

The single-file offline handbook was built and exercised at source
`1cd196ba829f65d17c5a95bdf2ea5f6078f0009e` through
`build-installer.bat -Component DocsCompanion`. These original page captures use an explicitly
emulated 1280 by 1000 viewport at scale 1, not a physical display-scale matrix.

All 21 bundled article/wiki routes rendered; guides, search and local preferences worked.
Separate runtime observations confirmed persistence across a full process restart. These images
do not establish updater behavior, installation, native browser operations or complete Settings
acceptance. The restart image is excluded because its diagnostic interval was not enabled.
